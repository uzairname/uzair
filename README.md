Hi I'm Uzair Mohammed. 

Undergraduate studying data science and mathematics.

I'm fascinated by "artificial intelligence". I don't think AI is just a field of computer science or a business tool. It's an age-old reflection on humanity. For the first time, engineers can formalize and experiment with centuries of theory in philosophy and cognitive science, seeing their real-time consequences on massive scales. Our path to AGI forces us to confront bizarre questions about the human experience, complex systems (from governments to cells), intelligence, and morality.

What does it *really* mean to reason, feel, and care like a human? How can we tell if something has an internal experience? What is the purpose of life, what's the goal of the universe, what *is* ethical, and how do we know if we're right? I argue that these questions, which for centuries have been distant philosophical musings, are likely to take on a shocking pragmatic significance in the next few centuries as we expand the scope and capabilities of AI technology.
